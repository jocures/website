The Bmore Black Techies website!


This is the donor branch!

We're using the [StartBootstrap Landing Page](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-landing-page)
template as the base for our landing page. We should move away from this eventually.

## Contributing
We are currently using Jekyll as a static site generator.

You need Ruby to use Jekyll. We recommend using
[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git) to install the correct Ruby
version, as this can differ system-to-system.

Once you have the correct version of Ruby installed (2.4.1 as of 26 April 2018),
install the required gems with `bundle install`.

To run the site locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

We use Github Pull Requests to contribute.</html>
